        Beyond my technical abilities, my background in Civil Engineering has equipped me with project management skills, a strong analytical mindset, and the ability to thrive in dynamic environments. I'm also proficient in communication, teamwork, and adapting to diverse challenges.
        <br>
        <br>
        Seeking a role in full-stack development, I'm eager to merge my engineering background with software development, contributing fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to the team.
        <br>
        <br>
        Excited for the opportunities ahead!
        <%# Now actively seeking opportunities to merge my problem-solving skills from engineering with coding expertise, I am eager to contribute, learn, and thrive in a dynamic tech environment.
