        Hi üëãüèº, I'm Pooja, a full-stack engineer with a background in civil engineering and over 5 years of industry experience.
        I successfully transitioned to technology through the Le Wagon coding bootcamp in London, excelling in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. During this journey, I launched web applications like <strong> SlopeRentals </strong> and <strong> WasteNot </strong>.

        Now actively seeking opportunities to merge my problem-solving skills from engineering with coding expertise, I am eager to contribute, learn, and thrive in a dynamic tech environment. My unique blend of engineering acumen and full-stack proficiency makes me a valuable asset to any team.
