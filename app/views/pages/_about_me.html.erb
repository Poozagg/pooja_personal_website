        I'm currently undergoing an exciting transition from an accomplished Civil Engineer with over 5 years of experience to a tech enthusiast.

        Recently, I successfully graduated from the Le Wagon coding bootcamp in London, where I delved into the world of full-stack web development. Proficient in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've designed, implemented, and launched web applications such as SlopeRentals and WasteNot.

        Now, armed with a robust background in both engineering and technology, I'm actively seeking a role that allows me to combine my problem-solving skills from engineering with my newfound coding expertise. I'm eager to contribute, learn, and thrive in a dynamic tech environment. If you're looking for a versatile professional with a unique blend of engineering and tech skills, let's connect!
